# ADAU1787 Startup Process

This document describes the ADAU1787 startup behavior implemented by this
repository. It follows the path from application boot to live PCM traffic and
separates two operations that happen at different times:

1. **Codec initialization** resets, releases, and programs the ADAU1787.
2. **Audio stream startup** configures the software pipeline and starts the
   nRF5340 I2S peripheral when BIS audio begins.

The codec is therefore programmed before BCLK and LRCK begin toggling.

The last two base-board files are supplied by the sibling `boards` repository,
not by this application repository. The Tiresias DK uses them directly. Other
targets can enable `CONFIG_AUDIO_CODEC_ADAU1787` independently by supplying an
equivalent `adau_1787` node in an application devicetree overlay.

The Device Controller subsystem runs its subscriber loop on the main thread. It publishes
separate initialization commands to the statically created Codec Controller and Audio
Streaming threads. The Codec Controller owns `hw_codec_init()` and ADAU1787 mode control;
the Audio Streaming subsystem owns `audio_system_init()` and the Bluetooth-to-I2S pipeline
lifecycle.

The `CODEC_CONTROLLER_STATE_*` values describe private state owned by the Codec Controller
subsystem. Its Zbus state channel mirrors that state for other subsystems and is not the
authoritative state store.

For the current headset configuration (`CONFIG_AUDIO_DEV=1`), `audio_system_init()` follows
the I2S audio-datapath branch. Hardware-codec initialization is deliberately absent from
that module because it belongs to the Codec Controller. The USB bypass is only selected
for a gateway built with `CONFIG_AUDIO_SOURCE_USB`.

## Compile-Time Hardware Description

The driver creates an `i2c_dt_spec` and five `gpio_dt_spec` objects from the
`adau_1787` devicetree node. Startup cannot be compiled without the node and
its required `powerdown-gpios` and MP3-through-MP6 GPIO properties.

### Control interface

The base board definition places the ADAU1787 on `i2c1`:

| Property | Effective configuration |
| --- | --- |
| I2C controller | `i2c1`, labeled `I2C_1` |
| 7-bit codec address | `0x2B` |
| SDA | P1.2 |
| SCL | P1.3 |
| Devicetree bus rate | Fast Plus mode |
| nRF concatenation buffer | 4092 bytes |

`adau1787_init()` verifies that the bus selected by the codec's `i2c_dt_spec`
is ready. Bus instance, pins, and bitrate come from devicetree; the driver does
not assume TWIM1 or override the configured bus speed. This allows a DK overlay
to place an external EVAL-ADAU1787 on any suitable I2C controller and GPIO
header pins.

The generated SigmaStudio headers contain `DEVICE_ADDR_* = 0x50`, but that
value does **not** choose the target on this platform. `SigmaStudioFW.h` accepts
the generated `devAddress` argument and ignores it; every generated transfer is
forwarded to `adau1787_write()`, which uses the address from devicetree
(`0x2B` on the Tiresias DK).

### Reset, multipurpose, and audio pins

| Signal | Effective nRF5340 pin | Startup behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ADAU1787 `!PD` | P1.0, active low | Asserted while GPIOs are configured, then released before programming |
| MP3 | P1.14 | Configured as inactive output (physical low) |
| MP4 | P1.15 | Configured as inactive output (physical low) |
| MP5 | P1.12 | Configured as inactive output (physical low) |
| MP6 | P1.13 | Configured as inactive output (physical low) |
| I2S MCK | P1.1 | Configured by I2S pinctrl |
| I2S SCK | P0.6 | Driven by the nRF5340 I2S master when the stream starts |
| I2S LRCK | P0.7 | Driven by the nRF5340 I2S master when the stream starts |
| I2S SDOUT | P0.4 | nRF5340 transmit data to the codec |
| I2S SDIN | P0.5 | Codec transmit data to the nRF5340 |

The application overlay performs a temporary pin swap: it moves MP3 through
MP6 onto the base board's original I2S data/clock pins and moves the four I2S
signals to P0.4 through P0.7. MCK remains on P1.1.

Zephyr's GPIO API uses logical levels. Because `!PD` is declared
`GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW`, configuring it with `GPIO_OUTPUT_ACTIVE` physically drives
the line low and holds the codec in power-down. Calling
`gpio_pin_set_dt(..., 0)` later drives it physically high and releases the
codec.

## Stage 1: Prepare the nRF Audio Interface

`audio_system_init()` first calls `audio_datapath_init()`, which registers the
I2S block-completion callback and calls `audio_i2s_init()`.

`audio_i2s_init()`:

1. Configures the nRF audio clock for 12.288 MHz.
2. Starts HFCLKAUDIO and waits without a timeout for the started event.
3. Applies the `i2s0` default pinctrl state.
4. Connects and enables the I2S interrupt.
5. Initializes I2S instance 0 and leaves it in the idle state.

The nRF5340 is the I2S master. The peripheral uses I2S format, left alignment,
stereo channels, ACLK as its source, and the selected application sample width.
The source defaults select 48 kHz, 16-bit audio, and a 128x MCK/LRCK ratio when
no build overlay changes those Kconfig choices. At this stage the peripheral is
configured but `nrfx_i2s_start()` has not been called, so regular BCLK/LRCK
frames are not yet running.

## Stage 2: Verify the Control Bus and Configure Pins

`hw_codec_init()` is a thin wrapper around `adau1787_init()`. The driver begins
by logging `Initializing audio codec...` and verifying that the
devicetree-selected I2C bus initialized successfully. It then calls
`adau1787_config_gpios()`.

The GPIO setup is deliberately ordered as follows:

1. Verify the `!PD` GPIO controller is ready.
2. Configure `!PD` as an active output, asserting the active-low pin. This
   gives every nRF5340 reset a corresponding codec reset/power-down pulse.
3. Verify and configure MP3, MP4, MP5, and MP6 one at a time as inactive
   outputs.

Each readiness or configuration failure stops this phase. A controller that is
not ready produces `-ENODEV`; a GPIO configuration error is propagated as
returned by Zephyr.

## Stage 3: Release `!PD`

After the GPIOs are ready, the driver calls `adau1787_power_up()`. Power-up
writes logical zero to the active-low `!PD` specifier, releasing the physical
pin high. The firmware then sleeps for a fixed 100 ms before making the first
codec transfer.

There is no device-ID probe or readiness poll between release and programming.
The 100 ms delay is the only driver-level stabilization interval at this point.

## Stage 4: Load the SigmaDSP Configuration

`default_download_IC_1_Sigma()` is generated by SigmaStudio. The current export
contains 209 operations: 208 write calls and one requested delay. Each write
macro calls `adau1787_write()` directly and becomes a separate I2C transaction.

The generated sequence has these broad phases:

1. Stop the SigmaDSP (`SDSP_CTRL2 = 0x00`), set the initial DAC volume values,
   and power down the ADC/DAC/headphone block (`ADC_DAC_HP_PWR = 0x00`).
2. Program chip power and clock control, including `CHIP_PWR = 0x17`, clock
   control registers, PLL/microphone-bias/PGA power, and the SigmaDSP/FastDSP
   power controls.
3. Configure the power gates and complete signal path: ADCs, PGAs, microphone
   bias, digital microphones, DAC/headphone, interpolators, decimators, ASRCs,
   FastDSP, SigmaDSP, and keep-alive behavior.
4. Configure multipurpose pins, serial-clock pins, serial ports 0 and 1 and
   their routes, interrupt masks/status registers, self-boot/software-enable,
   and PDM input/output routing.
5. Burst-write the compiled SigmaDSP image and initial parameters:

   | Image | Control-port start address | Payload | DSP words |
   | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
   | SigmaDSP program | `0x5000` | 845 bytes | 169 x 40-bit words |
   | SigmaDSP parameters | `0x2000` | 72 bytes | 18 x 32-bit words |

6. Enable the analog conversion/output block (`ADC_DAC_HP_PWR = 0x3F`), set
   both final DAC volume bytes to `0x40`, and start the SigmaDSP
   (`SDSP_CTRL2 = 0x01`).

The generated register list is authoritative for exact routing and field
values. The phase names above summarize the order without duplicating more than
200 generated assignments that will change when the SigmaStudio project is
re-exported.

### Generated delay behavior

The generated sequence places `SIGMA_WRITE_DELAY` immediately after the first
`CHIP_PWR = 0x17` write. Its data array is `{0x00, 0x23}`. The adapter decodes
this two-byte field as a big-endian unsigned value with `sys_get_be16()` and
therefore sleeps for **35 ms**. A compile-time assertion requires generated
delay fields to remain two bytes wide.

This 35 ms generated delay is separate from the driver's earlier 100 ms wait
after releasing `!PD`.

## Stage 5: Start the FastDSP

After the Sigma download returns, `adau1787_init()` calls
`default_download_IC_1_Fast()`. The current FastDSP export contains only two
writes to `FDSP_RUN` at address `0xC061`:

1. Write `0x00` to stop the FastDSP.
2. Write `0x01` to start the FastDSP.

Taken together, initialization makes 210 I2C write transactions: 208 from the
Sigma download and two from the FastDSP sequence. The largest is the program
download, for which `adau1787_write()` builds an 847-byte local buffer: two
big-endian address bytes followed by 845 payload bytes.

## I2C Transfer Format and Error Latching

Every write uses this wire-level payload:

```text
[sub-address MSB] [sub-address LSB] [data byte 0] ... [data byte N]
```

`i2c_write_dt()` supplies the I2C target address from devicetree. The ADAU1787
then auto-increments its internal address during a burst. Reads first write the
same two-byte sub-address and then use a repeated-start read through
`i2c_write_read_dt()`.

The generated SigmaStudio macros discard individual return values. To retain
failure information, `adau1787_write()` stores any nonzero I2C result in the
file-static `adau_init_error`. Successful later writes do not clear it. After
both generated downloads finish, `adau1787_init()` checks that latch.

This arrangement has several consequences:

- A failed generated transfer does not immediately stop the remaining
  download; subsequent writes are still attempted.
- The initialization fails after the full sequence if any generated write
  failed.
- The latch is not reset at the beginning of `adau1787_init()`. If code calls
  initialization again after a failed attempt, the old error remains latched.
- Direct read failures and argument-validation failures outside the generated
  download are returned normally and do not use this latch.

Driver setup failures and the final latched programming error are passed to
`ERR_CHK_MSG`. In this repository that macro logs the supplied message and
error code, then calls `k_oops()`. Therefore `adau1787_init()` returns zero only
if execution reaches its final `Audio codec initialization done.` log; its
setup failures are fatal rather than ordinary recoverable returns in the
current call path.

## Stage 6: Start Live I2S

Successful programming moves the Codec Controller to `LOCAL_ONLY`, but it does not start
PCM traffic. The codec stays powered and programmed while the Audio Streaming subsystem
discovers and synchronizes to a broadcast source.

When the Audio Streaming subsystem receives `LE_AUDIO_EVT_STREAMING`, it calls
`audio_system_start()`:

1. Select the headset software-codec configuration.
2. Initialize the transmit and receive FIFOs if needed.
3. Initialize the LC3 software codec and its worker thread if required.
4. Start the double-buffered I2S transfer through `audio_datapath_start()`.
   This is the point at which `nrfx_i2s_start()` enables continuous audio
   frames.
5. Sleep 10 ms to let the I2S path settle, then mark the pipeline as running.

Calls to `hw_codec_default_conf_enable()` and `hw_codec_log_status_2()` remain commented out
in `audio_system.c` because hardware-codec control belongs to the Codec Controller. The
status helper is still available for a future Codec Controller diagnostic action.

`adau1787_log_status_2()` reports the raw status byte and decodes all eight
bits:

| Bit | Field | Logged meaning when set |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 7 | `POWER_UP_COMPLETE` | Power domains completed power-up after `POWER_EN=1` |
| 6 | `SYNC_LOCK` | Multichip synchronization is locked |
| 5 | `SPT1_LOCK` | Serial port 1 is locked |
| 4 | `SPT0_LOCK` | Serial port 0 is locked |
| 3 | `ASRCO_LOCK` | Output ASRC is locked |
| 2 | `ASRCI_LOCK` | Input ASRC is locked |
| 1 | `AVDD_UVW` | AVDD undervoltage was detected |
| 0 | `PLL_LOCK` | PLL is locked |

Any future status read is diagnostic only. Startup does not currently read or poll these
fields, wait for a particular combination, retry initialization, or change state when a
lock bit is clear.

## Stop and Restart Behavior

`audio_system_stop()` stops the data pipeline without calling
`hw_codec_soft_reset()` or `adau1787_power_down()`. As a result:

- stopping a stream leaves the ADAU1787 released from `!PD`, powered, and
  programmed;
- a later `LE_AUDIO_EVT_STREAMING` restarts I2S without downloading the
  SigmaStudio images again; and
- the full reset/programming sequence normally runs only once, during Codec
  Controller subsystem initialization after application boot.

## Expected Logs and Troubleshooting Order

A normal boot contains these codec-specific milestones, with logs from the Device
Controller, Control Link, and Audio Streaming subsystems and the audio modules
interleaved because initialization is thread-driven:

```text
Initializing audio codec...
Audio codec initialization done.
```

When startup fails, check in this order:

1. **Devicetree selection:** confirm the build has an enabled `adau_1787` node,
   the correct EVAL-board I2C address, and the expected power-down and MP GPIO
   assignments. On the Tiresias DK, also confirm the expected swapped MP/I2S
   pins.
2. **GPIO readiness and polarity:** `!PD` must first go physically low and then
   high; MP3 through MP6 remain low during initialization.
3. **I2C bus setup:** verify the controller, SDA/SCL pins, and bitrate selected
   by the target devicetree. A bus-readiness failure is logged and returned.
4. **First transfer timing:** the first I2C transaction occurs 100 ms after
   `!PD` release. The generated `{0x00, 0x23}` delay adds 35 ms after the first
   `CHIP_PWR = 0x17` write.
5. **Programming error logs:** an `I2C write failed` message identifies the
   target address and only the high byte of the internal register address in
   its current log formatting. Any such failure is latched until the final
   programming check.
6. **Clock timing:** codec programming happens before I2S frames start. BCLK and
   LRCK should appear only after the LE Audio streaming event; MCK pinctrl and
   HFCLKAUDIO are prepared earlier.
7. **Codec status:** automatic STATUS2 logging is currently disabled. If it is
   reintroduced as a Codec Controller diagnostic action, treat the lock lines
   as diagnostics rather than startup gates.

## Maintaining the Startup Sequence

The files under `src/SigmaStudioFiles/` are generated artifacts. A SigmaStudio
schematic change can alter register values, program bytes, parameter data, and
parameter addresses together. Replace the full export as one unit and follow
the pristine-build workflow in `docs/development/workflow.md`; do not manually
edit the generated startup list.

Persistent platform behavior belongs in the handwritten layers:

- change bus/GPIO wiring in devicetree and its binding;
- change reset timing, error handling, or explicit probes in
  `src/drivers/adau1787.c`;
- change SigmaStudio macro adaptation in `src/drivers/SigmaStudioFW.h`; and
- change codec-versus-stream lifecycle ordering in `audio_system.c` or the Codec
  Controller subsystem's state machine.

If the download is regenerated, recheck the operation counts, image sizes and
addresses, stop/start register values, and delay encoding quoted in this
document. Those details describe the current export and are not stable API.
